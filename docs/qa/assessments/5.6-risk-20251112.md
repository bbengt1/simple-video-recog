# Risk Profile: Story 5.6

Date: 2025-11-12
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 6
- Critical Risks: 1
- High Risks: 2
- Risk Score: 55/100 (calculated)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. PERF-003: Metrics Polling Performance Impact

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - Polling every 5 seconds could impact system performance
**Impact**: High - High CPU usage from frequent API calls, degraded user experience
**Mitigation**:

- Implement Page Visibility API to pause polling when tab hidden
- Use efficient polling with proper cleanup
- Monitor memory usage during development
- Add polling frequency controls

**Testing Focus**: Performance monitoring during 24-hour test runs, memory leak detection, CPU usage analysis

## Risk Distribution

### By Category

- Performance: 3 risks (1 critical)
- Technical: 2 risks (0 critical)
- Operational: 1 risk (0 critical)

### By Component

- MetricsPanel polling: 2 risks
- API endpoint load: 2 risks
- System metrics accuracy: 2 risks

## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID | Category | Title | Probability | Impact | Score | Status |
|---------|----------|-------|-------------|--------|-------|--------|
| PERF-003 | Performance | Metrics Polling Performance Impact | High (3) | High (3) | 9 | Critical |
| PERF-004 | Performance | Memory Leaks in Metrics Component | Medium (2) | High (3) | 6 | High |
| TECH-003 | Technical | Inaccurate System Metrics | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 4 | Medium |
| TECH-004 | Technical | Browser Compatibility Issues | Low (1) | High (3) | 3 | Low |
| OPS-003 | Operational | API Endpoint Overload | Medium (2) | Low (1) | 2 | Low |
| PERF-005 | Performance | Slow Metric Updates | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Low |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

- Performance monitoring during extended polling periods
- Memory usage tracking over 24-hour test runs
- CPU usage analysis during frequent API calls
- Page Visibility API functionality verification

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- Memory leak detection tests
- Component cleanup verification
- Polling pause/resume functionality

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- Metric accuracy validation
- Browser compatibility tests
- API load testing

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All critical risks (score 9) - polling performance impact
- High risks affecting system stability - memory leaks

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Medium risks with monitoring - metric accuracy issues
- Low risks with basic validation - browser compatibility

### Accepted Risks

- None - all risks require mitigation for reliable metrics display

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Metrics polling performance impact
- Memory usage trends during dashboard usage
- API endpoint response times
- User-reported performance issues

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- User reports of slow dashboard performance
- Memory usage issues detected
- API endpoint performance degradation
- Browser compatibility complaints
