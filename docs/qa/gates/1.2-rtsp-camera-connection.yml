nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'No hardcoded credentials. Error messages do not expose sensitive data. Proper exception handling prevents information leakage.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Non-blocking threading architecture. Queue-based buffering (max 100 frames) prevents memory issues. Frame rate control (30fps max) prevents CPU saturation.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Exponential backoff reconnection (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s) handles transient failures. Graceful degradation on connection loss. Thread lifecycle properly managed.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Google-style docstrings on all public methods. Clear separation of concerns. Type hints throughout. Import organization follows PEP 8.'
